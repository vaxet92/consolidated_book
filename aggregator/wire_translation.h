// KEY: nullopt rather than a defaulted MarketType - the same choice

// is here: a merged book has up to 1000 levels with several contributors each,
// which is thousands of lookups to produce at most kMaxVenues distinct
// answers. Build the table once from Core::VenueName, then index it.
//
// KNOWN LIMIT: wire::Venue is itself a fixed proto enum (BINANCE/BYBIT/OKX),
// so a fourth venue would resolve to VENUE_UNSPECIFIED here even though
// md_core handles it correctly. Removing that needs a proto change - carrying
// a slot plus a per-message slot->name dictionary (§17.7's B3) - which changes
// the published contract and every client, and is NOT done.

// Attribution: which venue contributed, and how much.

// KEY: carries a VenueSlot, not a VenueId. md_core has no compile-time list of
// venues (DESIGN.md §17.6) - a slot is whatever registered, and the name is
// resolved at the WIRE boundary via Core::VenueName. Keeping a VenueId here
// would put the enum back in the middle of the merged output, which is the one
// place it is hardest to remove later.
//
// It is also smaller and cheaper: VenueSlot is one byte against VenueId's two,
// and the merge writes this per output level, so the array below sits in every
// MergedLevel. And because the merge loop's index IS the slot, filling it
// needs no lookup at all - not even the array read the VenueId version needed.

    // Default member initializers, not just relying on the caller to

    // (default-init, not value-init) leaves fundamental-type members as
    // indeterminate garbage, not 0. The merge logic in ComputeBBO depends
    // on price==0 meaning "nothing seen yet" - without these, that check
    // silently reads garbage instead.

// the publisher never calls this before the first ApplyUpdate.

// Eager BBO merge (DESIGN_1 §5.2): compares each venue's cached best
// bid/ask, no k-way merge over full depth. O(venues) per call, not O(depth).
// Named ComputeBBO, not BBO, to avoid colliding with the struct above -
// C++ lets a function and a struct share a name, but the function then
// hides the struct name for lookup inside its own body, which breaks
// `BBO result;` in the implementation.
//
// Templated on the book array for the same reason as MergeBooks, but with a
// much smaller blast radius: this function only ever calls BestBid()/BestAsk(),
// which both implementations expose identically, so its BODY is unchanged.
//
// Explicitly instantiated in consolidated_bbo.cpp for MapOrderBookArray (the
// std::map oracle) and FlatBookArray (production) - the same closed set, and
// the same deliberate link error for anything outside it.

BBO ComputeBBO(const BookArray& books);

// Consolidates the fast-BBO stream quotes (DESIGN_1 §4.4 option 1). Same
// max-bid / min-ask / tie-attribution logic as ComputeBBO, but sourced
// from the venues' own top-of-book channels instead of our depth books:
// lower latency, and independent of depth-book sync state.
// VenueQuoteArray comes from types.h - unqualified here because
// `consolidated` is nested inside market_data.
//
// Full scan over all venues, O(venues). Used to build from scratch, as the
// rescan fallback inside UpdateBBOWithQuote, and as the test oracle the
// incremental path is checked against - the same role std::map plays for
// MapOrderBook (§5.1).
// `health` excludes venues whose verdict is not kLive, exactly as in
// MergeBooks; nullptr admits everyone. Same reasoning for the default: a pure
// function merges what it is handed, and admission is the caller's policy.
BBO ComputeBBOFromQuotes(const VenueQuoteArray& quotes, const VenueHealthArray* health = nullptr);

// Same computation, filling an existing BBO instead of returning a new one.
//
// This exists for the health-change rescan. Assigning the by-value version
// over Core's running BBO would replace the attribution vectors, throwing
// away the capacity Core::Init reserves so the hot path never allocates
// (DESIGN_1 §7.5). Filling in place keeps those buffers.
void ComputeBBOFromQuotesInto(const VenueQuoteArray& quotes, BBO& out, const VenueHealthArray* health = nullptr);

// Incremental: folds one venue's new quote into an existing BBO.
// O(venues at the best level) - typically 1 - instead of O(venues), falling
// back to a full rescan of one side only when the last venue leaves that
// side's best level. Built for larger venue counts; at 3 venues it is a
// wash with ComputeBBOFromQuotes.
//
// PRECONDITION: `quotes` must ALREADY contain `update` - the caller stores
// the quote before calling this, because the rescan path re-reads it from
// there. Passing a stale array silently produces a wrong book, and only on
// the rare rescan path, so the bug would hide for a long time.
//
// A quote from a venue that is not kLive is treated exactly as a quote with
// price 0 - "this venue has no bid/ask" - which runs the existing
// remove-and-rescan branch. Nothing special is needed for it.
//
// KEY: filtering here is NOT sufficient on its own. This function maintains
// PERSISTENT state, so a stale venue's price is already folded into
// `current`, and a venue that has gone quiet sends nothing more to displace
// it. Excluding it requires the caller to force a full ComputeBBOFromQuotes
// rescan when a venue's health CHANGES (DESIGN_1 §6.6). Filtering a stateless
// recomputation is easy; filtering an incremental one needs the transition.
//
// `slot` is where this venue's entry lives in `quotes` and in `health`, and it
// is passed rather than derived from update.venue.
//
// KEY: those two arrays are indexed by SLOT, while update.venue is a VenueId.
// They coincide today only because venues happen to register in enum order
// (DESIGN.md §17.6). Deriving the index from the VenueId would read ANOTHER
// venue's health verdict once they diverge - admitting a stale venue, or
// excluding a live one, with nothing in the output to show for it.
//
// Passed in rather than looked up so this function stays pure: it takes no
// registry, holds no state, and md_core keeps exactly one place where a
// VenueId becomes a slot.

// consolidation, not consolidated output - which is why it lives here at
// market_data scope, mirroring VenueBookArray, rather than in the
// `consolidated` namespace.
//
// Sized by kMaxVenues (fixed CAPACITY) rather than kVenueCount (compile-time
// venue LIST) - DESIGN.md §17.6, same reason and same step as VenueBookArray.
//
// KEY: unlike VenueBookArray this holds values, not pointers, so there is no
// null to check. Safety comes from the sentinel that already exists: an unused
// slot is a default-constructed BboQuote with price = 0, which every reader
// already treats as "this venue hasn't sent one yet". The new slots are in a
// state the code has always handled - they are simply venues that never spoke.
//
// MEASURED COST, accepted deliberately: bbo_fullscan is ~104 ns for 3 venues
// (becnhmark_results.md). Until the loop bounds move from kVenueCount to the
// registry's runtime size, that scan walks 8 slots instead of 3 and is
// correspondingly slower. bbo_incremental - the common path, ~0-42 ns - is
// untouched, and the fullscan only runs when a BBO health verdict changes
// (md_core.h), not per quote. The regression is real, temporary, and closes
// when the loop bounds migrate.
//
// Space: BboQuote is ~72 bytes, so 5 unused slots is ~360 bytes per instrument
// - roughly 3.6 KB at 10 instruments. An order of magnitude more than
// VenueBookArray's pointers, still small enough not to trade correctness for.

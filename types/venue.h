// speak every 3 seconds because Bybit says it does" is defensible in a

// guess, it says so rather than pretending otherwise.
//
// KEY: too SHORT is the dangerous direction. A backstop below a venue's real
// quiet interval marks a healthy feed stale and flaps it in and out of the
// merge, which is worse than having no watchdog at all. Every placeholder
// below is therefore generous. These are BACKSTOPS, not detectors - fast
// detection is meant to come from connection state and, once built,

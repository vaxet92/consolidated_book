// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Runtime instrument identity.
//
// `InstrumentId` in venue.h is a compile-time enum, so the set of tradable
// symbols is fixed when the binary is built. Adding a symbol means editing two
// hand-written lookups in a header and recompiling - in Docker, rebuilding the
// image. A config file cannot help, because no file read at runtime can add an
// enumerator.
//
// This registry replaces the enumerators. Ids are handed out at load time, in
// the order the config lists the symbols, so the symbol universe comes from
// JSON instead of from source.
//
// It is deliberately the same design as VenueRegistry (venue_registry.h), for
// the same reason: one threading story and one lifetime story to explain
// instead of two.
//
// KEY: this costs nothing on the hot path. InstrumentId is a uint16_t either
// way - InstrumentKey's bit layout, BookUpdate's POD-ness in the SPSC ring and
// the identity hash are all untouched. The only thing that moves is WHERE the
// string <-> id table lives: out of a switch in a header, into an array built
// once at startup.
//
// KEY: ids are PROCESS-LOCAL. They depend on config order, so two aggregators
// with differently ordered configs disagree about which id is BTCUSDT. That is
// safe only because no id ever leaves the process - the gRPC wire carries the
// symbol string (aggregator.proto). The day an id goes on the wire or into a
// file, this breaks.
//
// Nothing here changes behaviour yet. venue.h keeps its enumerators and every
// existing call site still compiles; they migrate in a later step.
//
// KEY: during that migration a registry id and an InstrumentId enumerator are
// both small integers, and - because the config lists BTCUSDT first - they hold
// the SAME value. That is exactly when a mix-up compiles and does the right
// thing right up until the config is reordered. Same trap VenueRegistry calls
// out for VenueId vs VenueSlot.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Upper bound on symbols known at once. Fixed CAPACITY, runtime SIZE.
//
// This is a bound on THIS process's name table, not a domain limit: a real
// symbol universe is thousands, and would size a reserved vector from the
// config instead. 64 is far more than this project subscribes to, and holding
// the names in a fixed array is what keeps Name()'s views valid (see Name).
inline constexpr size_t kMaxInstruments = 64;

// Canonical symbol form: uppercase, with separators removed.
//
//   "btc-usdt" -> "BTCUSDT"
//   "BTC/USDT" -> "BTCUSDT"
//   "btcusdt"  -> "BTCUSDT"
//
// KEY: only KNOWN separators are removed - '-', '_', '/' and ASCII whitespace.
// Anything else is left in place so it fails validation rather than being
// silently deleted. Deleting an unexpected character would let two different
// strings normalise to one symbol, which is how a client subscribing to one
// instrument quietly receives another.
//
// Allocates. Called once per instrument at startup and once per Subscribe
// request - never on the message path.

// Why a symbol was rejected, so the caller can report WHICH problem it hit

// message - by the time it validates, it holds only the normalised form, not
// the raw string as the operator typed it, and it knows nothing about which
// config file or which entry the symbol came from. The loader has all three,
// so the reason travels back to it and the message is written there. That also

// here is then a compiler warning instead of a silent "unknown" at runtime -

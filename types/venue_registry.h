// Runtime venue identity (DESIGN.md §17.6).
//
// `VenueId` in venue.h is a compile-time enum, and `kVenueCount` sizes every
// per-venue array in md_core. That means adding a venue is a RECOMPILE of the
// core - the exact thing §17 exists to avoid, because it turns "add a venue"
// into "restart everything and gap every client".
//
// This registry replaces the enum as md_core's notion of a venue. The core
// stores an opaque VenueSlot; it never learns the string "binance". The name
// travels only as far as attribution and logging.
//
// Nothing here changes behaviour yet. venue.h and kVenueCount stay exactly as
// they are, and the arrays in md_core migrate one file at a time.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Upper bound on venues known at once. Fixed CAPACITY, runtime SIZE.
//
// KEY: this is what buys the whole design. A std::vector would also be
// runtime-sized, but growing it reallocates - and the merge path reads these
// arrays from another thread, so a reallocation would invalidate references
// underneath a live reader. A fixed array cannot move, so registration is
// safe while the consolidator runs.
//
// 8 is a deliberate bound, not a guess at some limit: more venues than a
// consolidated crypto book has any use for, and small enough that the arrays
// it sizes stay cache-friendly.
inline constexpr size_t kMaxVenues = 8;

// Dense index into md_core's per-venue arrays, assigned at registration.
//
// KEY: a strong type, not a typedef for uint8_t. During the migration a
// VenueId and a VenueSlot are both small integers and - because venues are
// registered in enum order today - they hold the SAME values. That is exactly
// when a typedef stops protecting you: every mix-up compiles and does the
// right thing until the day a venue is registered out of order, at which
// point prices are attributed to the wrong exchange. An enum class makes the
// compiler refuse the mix-up instead.

// Maps venue names to dense slots.
//
// Names, not VenueIds, because that is what the wire carries: in the split
// topology a provider announces itself in the kHello handshake (§17.7) and
// md_core never sees an enum. Keying on the name now means this does not have
// to be redone when the process split lands.
//
// Matching is EXACT and case-sensitive. Callers normalise - today that is
// VenueConverter::ToVenueString, which yields "BINANCE", "BYBIT", "OKX".
//
// THREADING: single writer, many readers. One thread calls Register (startup
// today; the socket-accept thread once providers dial in, §17.4). Any number
// of threads may call Find/Name/size concurrently with it. Two threads calling
// Register at the same time is not supported and is not needed - registration
// happens on exactly one control path.

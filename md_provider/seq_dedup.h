// Duplicate rejection for redundant WebSocket connections ("line arbitration").
//
// With --connections=N, N sockets carry the SAME messages. Exactly one copy
// must reach the book; the other N-1 must be dropped. The benefit is failover:
// when one socket dies the others are already delivering, so there is no gap,
// no resync and no REST refetch.
//
// Where this sits:
//
//     N sockets -> parse -> SeqDedup -> continuity check -> Emit -> Core
//
// AFTER parse, because is_reset needs the parsed message.
//
// KEY: BEFORE the continuity check. Continuity is a state machine keyed on the
// last sequence number - a duplicate reaching CheckBinanceContinuity looks
// like U != last_u + 1, which it reports as a gap and resyncs on. Redundant
// connections would then cause the exact outage they were added to prevent.
//
// One instance per (venue, stream). Six in total: three venues x depth + BBO.
// Never shared between streams - Binance depth `u` and bookTicker `u` are
// different id spaces, and comparing across them is meaningless.
//
// Not thread-safe, and does not need to be: all N sessions of a provider are
// read by one io_context on one thread, so every call is serialized.
